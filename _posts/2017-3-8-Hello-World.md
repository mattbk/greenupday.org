In Vermont (where I grew up), there’s an annual tradition called “Green Up Day,” which is a day when Vermonters head out to the roadsides and pick up all the trash they can find. It started as a state event and is now run by a non-profit. Check them out and support them at [greenupvermont.org](greenupvermont.org).

I’d like to take this concept worldwide. To that end, I’ve just purchased [greenupday.org](greenupday.org). This is not affiliated with [Green Up Vermont](greenupvermont.org) in any way except for the name and idea. If you have money to give, give it to them. 

This website will take some small effort to set up, but I’m hoping to spark some grassroots greening up.

Plan for the first Saturday in May. Use hashtag #greenupday to spread the word on social media.

More to come. Let’s get to work.
